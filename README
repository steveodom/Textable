Find the closet free wifi, public library, or walgreens by texting 512 782-2513 with your command and postal code or airport code. Commands are wifi, library, walgreens, and help. Eg. "wifi 78702". Or "walgreens AUS"

Walmarts and ATM's are coming soon.

What Problem Does this Solve?

Oh yeah. You just landed in a new city and realized you forgot your cherry limeade chapstick. So you text "walgreens AUS" to 512 782-2513. A second later you get a text back with the closest Walgreens. Boom.

You check in to your hotel and ask yourself "where the free wifi at?" Is that textable? Next thing you know you're at a Panera pulling down torrents at 83kb/s while eating a nice artisan focaccia.

Or maybe you just want to get your read on. (library 90210)

Textable helps you find a few important things nearby quickly.

Instructions:


--------------
To run:
shotgun remoteavore.rb -p 4567

NOTE: shotgun does not appear to be compatibility with mongo and 1.9.2. I get "keys must be strings or symbols"

Without shotgun:
ruby remoteavore.rb -p 4567

Note: shotgun is a gem that reloads sinatra at every request so to refresh the code. It's much slower, but if you're actively working in the code, it's probably worth it.
